    <p>If it had a front porch, I would be sitting on it and inviting you in for a glass of 2% milk. <br><br>I like to build things. You probably do too. I think that’s rad. Keep doing you, sir/miss. But this site isn’t about you, it’s about me, and that’s why it’s called wadelahring.com. <br><br>Sometimes I build things and leave them here. <br><br> <h2>UNBELIEVABLY GREAT PROJECTS</h2><a href="#">Vince Vaughn Portfolio</a><br><a href="#">Across the Vaughn-iverse</a></p>
